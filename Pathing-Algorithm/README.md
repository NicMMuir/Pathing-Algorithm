# Pathing-Algorithm
Pathing Algorithm using ASTAR and Dijkstra's algorithms.

Sample input :
3 1 5 25
1,1
17,17
4,4;10,10
15,15
5,1
0,17
11,11
5,5


First Line: Number of Neighbours, Number of Obsticles, Number of Points,Dimentions (Best to stick with 25x25 as the graphing functins only graphs to 25 or now)

Second Line: Starting Point
Third Line : End Point 

Forth Line: Obsticle Top Left Point and Bottom Right.

Next are the five other Points used for pathing.

Once input the program will display a graph with all possible paths and will display the shortest path(in terminal).
